Making notes to myself as I screw things up

I started the project today. I think that if I can get the game going in about a week of spare time I'll be pretty happy (it helps that this month has a big old deadline at the jobby-job). Still, the simplified version of the game shouldn't be *too* wild [^1].

While I'm focused on the one-hot vectors here (because that's what needs to go to the character-level ML agent), I'm going to write the translation layer to make the output human readable.
